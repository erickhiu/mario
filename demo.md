# Super Mario Construct

[Super Mario Construct](https://levelsharesquare.com/games/supermarioconstruct) is a fan-made level editor that allows users to create and play custom Mario levels. I used Super Mario Construct to visualize the level layouts in this proof and to create an interactive demo featured in my video.

# Demo Level

I also built a playable level based on the example formula:

$$
\phi = (x_1 \vee x_3 \vee \neg x_4) \wedge (\neg x_2 \vee x_3 \vee \neg x_5)
$$

If you want to try playing the level, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [Super Mario Construct](https://levelsharesquare.com/games/supermarioconstruct).
2. Click on `Play level`.
3. Copy and paste the following level code into the text box and press `Play`.
```

```
4. Enjoy the level!

## Remarks
- It is strongly recommended that you find a satisfiable assignment (if any) for $\phi$ before starting the level. This will help you determine the correct path through the variable gadgets and ensure you can activate the necessary Palace Switches in the clause gadgets.
*(Of course, feel free to try playing the level with an unsatisfiable assignment and see what happens!)*
- Upon reaching a “variable gadget” (X1, X2, X3, X4, X5), use the left exit if you assign that variable with `true`, use the right exit if you assign that variable with `false`.
- Upon reaching a “clause gadget” (C1, C2) from the bottom entrances, toggle the palace switch. **Be careful to not re-toggle any switch if you reenter the clause gadget**, otherwise the block will turn back to solid. 
- Upon reaching a “clause gadget” from the left entrance, try to **get a star** from the item blocks to transform into invincible Mario to get through the firebars.

# Unsatisfiable Formula

I also made another level for the formula

$$
(x_1 \vee x_1 \vee x_1) \wedge (\neg x_1 \vee \neg x_1 \vee \neg x_1)
$$

which is unsatisfiable.
