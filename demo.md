# Super Mario Construct Demo

[Super Mario Construct](https://levelsharesquare.com/games/supermarioconstruct3) is a fan-made level editor that allows users to create and play custom Mario levels. I used Super Mario Construct to visualize the level layouts in this proof and to create an interactive demo featured in my video.

I also built a playable level based on the example formula:

$$
\phi = (x_1 \vee x_3 \vee \neg x_4) \wedge (\neg x_2 \vee x_3 \vee \neg x_5)
$$
