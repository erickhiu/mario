# Super Mario Bos.

Super Mario Bros. is a classic platform game developed by Nintendo in 1985. 
The game follows **Mario**, an Italian plumber, on his quest to rescue 
**Princess Peach** from the villainous **Bowser**. Along the way, 
Mario must navigate challenging levels filled with obstacles, enemies, 
and power-ups.

## Key Elements of the Game

Mario has different forms that impact his abilities:

- **Normal Mario**: The default form with basic movement and jumping.
- **Super Mario**: Gained by collecting a **Super Mushroom**, allowing Mario to break bricks.
- **Invincible Mario**: Temporarily obtained by collecting a **Super Star**, making Mario immune to enemies and hazards.
