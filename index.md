# Super Mario Bros.

Super Mario Bros. is a classic platform game developed by Nintendo in 1985. The game follows **Mario**, an Italian plumber, on his quest to rescue **Princess Peach** from the villainous **Bowser**. Along the way, Mario must navigate challenging levels filled with obstacles, enemies, and power-ups.

Beyond its status as an iconic video game, Super Mario Bros. has been studied in computational complexity theory. In this discussion, we will explore how certain level configurations in the game can be used to encode logical constraints, ultimately proving that determining whether a given level is passable is an **NP-hard** problem. (In fact, the problem is NP-complete.)

I also made a **video explanation** of this proof, which you can watch below:

# Problem Formulation

## The $\text{3SAT}$ Problem

Before we define the Super Mario Bros. problem, let's introduce (or review) the 3-satisfiability ($\text{3SAT}$) problem. 

- A **Boolean formula** is a mathematical expression consisting of Boolean variables (taking values `true` or `false`), 
logical operators (AND ($\wedge$), OR ($\vee$), NOT ($\neg$)) and parentheses for grouping. It evaluates to either `true` or `false` based on variable assignment.
- A Boolean formula is **satisfiable** is there exists an assignment to the variables such that the formula evaluates to be true. 
- A **literal** is a Boolean variable or a negated Boolean variable, as in $x$ or $\neg x$.
- A **clause** is a *disjunction* ($\vee$) of several literals.
- A Boolean formula is in **conjunctive normal form** (CNF) is it is a *conjunction* ($\wedge$) of several clauses.
- A **3 CNF formula** is a CNF formula that has exactly *three* literals per clause. For example, 

$$
\phi = (x_1 \vee x_3 \vee \neg x_4) \wedge (\neg x_2 \vee x_3 \vee \neg x_5)
$$

is a satisfiable 3CNF formula. One true assignment is $x_1 = $ `true` and $x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = x_5 =$ `false`.

The $\text{3SAT}$ problem is defined to be the set of satisfiable 3CNF formula:

$$
\text{3SAT} = \{\phi: \text{$\phi$ is a satisfiable 3CNF formula}\}.
$$

We will show that the Super Mario Bros. problem is NP-hard via a [polynomial-time mapping reduction](https://eecs376.github.io/notes/complexity.html#polynomial-time-mapping-reductions) from $\text{3SAT}$. 

## The Super Mario Bros. Problem

Before we formally define the Super Mario Bros. problem, letâ€™s describe the core mechanics of the game that affect level passability.

- A Super Mario Bros. level consists of platforms, obstacles, enemies, and power-ups that Mario must navigate to reach the goal.
- A level is **passable** if Mario can reach the goal given the available power-ups and mechanics.

Here, we introduce several key elements of the game that are relevant to the reduction.

### Mario's Forms

Mario has different forms that impact his abilities:

- **Normal Mario**: The default form with basic movement and jumping.
- **Super Mario**: Gained by collecting a **Super Mushroom** <img src="assets/images/mario/mushroom.png" alt="Super Mushroom" width="20">, allowing Mario to break bricks.
- **Invincible Mario**: Temporarily obtained by collecting a **Super Star** <img src="assets/images/mario/star.jpg" alt="Super Star" width="20">, making Mario immune to enemies and hazards.

<img src="assets/images/mario/mario-forms.png" alt="Mario Forms" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

### Basic Environment Elements

Several types of blocks and structures shape the levels in *Super Mario Bros.*:

- **Normal Blocks** <img src="assets/images/mario/normal-block.png" alt="Normal Block" width="20"> : Static, inert blocks that Mario can stand on.
- **Item Blocks** <img src="assets/images/mario/item-block.png" alt="Item Block" width="20">: Contain power-ups such as **Super Mushrooms** or **Super Stars**, which are released when hit from below.
- **Bricks** <img src="assets/images/mario/brick.jpg" alt="Brick" width="20">: Can be destroyed by **Super Mario** when hit from below.
- **Pipes** <img src="assets/images/mario/pipe.png" alt="Pipe" width="20">: Transport Mario between different sections of a level.

To simplify our problem, we also allow the use of **palace switches** <img src="assets/images/mario/palace-switch.png" alt="Normal Block" width="20">: 

- When Mario toggles a **Palace Switch**, it transforms solid blocks of a matching color into transparent blocks.
- This allows Mario to access previously blocked paths and continue progressing through the level.

### The Level Passability Decision Problem

We define the **Super Mario Bros.** ($\text{SMB}$) language as the set of passable Super Mario Bros. levels:

$$
\text{SMB} = \{ S : S \text{ is a passable Super Mario Bros. level}\}.
$$

> - **Example of a non-passable level**: Mario (even as Super Mario) cannot pass through fire bars.
> 
<img src="assets/images/mario/not-passable.png" alt="Not passable" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">

> - **Example of a passable level**: Mario can collect a star from an item block, turn into Invincible Mario, and pass through fire bars.

# Polynomial-Time Mapping Reduction (PTMR)

Now, we will describe a PTMR from $\text{3SAT}$ to $\text{SMB}$. Given an a 3CNF formula, our goal is to construct a Super Mario Bros. level that is passable if and only if the formula is satisfiable.

A common trick for reducing from $\text{3SAT}$ is to create variable "gadgets" and clause "gadgets". In our reduction, each gadget would correspond to a part of a level. For simplicity, we will put each part in a map and use pipes to teleports between them.

> For example, the formula $\phi = (x_1 \vee x_3 \vee \neg x_4) \wedge (\neg x_2 \vee x_3 \vee \neg x_5)$ has five variables and two clauses, so we will have five variables gadgets and two clause gadgets.

## Variable Gadgets

Each variable gadget represents a Boolean variable $x_i$ and provides two possible exits: one corresponding to $x_i =$ `true` and one to $x_i =$ `false`. 

Mario enters the variable gadget from above. The design ensures that once Mario drops down from the entrance platform, he **cannot jump back up**, enforcing a *one-way passage*. This guarantees that each variable is assigned a consistent truth value throughout the level.  

- If Mario chooses the **`true` path**, he will be visiting **clause gadgets containing $x_i$**.
- If Mario chooses the **`false` path**, he will be visiting **clause gadgets containing $\neg x_i$**.

    <img src="assets/images/mario/variable-gadget.png" alt="Variable Gadget" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;">

## Clause Gadgets

Each clause gadget represents a clause in the 3SAT formula and ensures that Mario can only pass through if at least one of the literals in the clause is `true`. There are two ways of entering the clause gadget: either through the literal entrances or the left entrance. 

The clause gadget has **three literal entrance/exit pairs**, each corresponding to one of the three literals in the clause.

- If Mario arrives through any of these entrances, it means the corresponding literal is `true`.
- This allows Mario to toggle a Palace Switch, which turns the solid block into a transparent block.
- Once toggled, the block remainds transparent for the rest of the level. 
- Mario leaves the clause gadget using the corresponding literal exit.

When Mario (re)enters the clause gadget using the left entrance, if at least one of the Palace switches have been toggled before, then Mario can obtain the Super star, transform into invincible Mario, get through the fire bars and exit through the right exit. Otherwise, Mario will not be able to pass through this clause gadget when he enters through the left entrance.

<img src="assets/images/mario/clause-gadget.png" alt="Clause Gadget" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">

## Connecting The Gadgets

Now that we have constructed the variable gadgets and clause gadgets, we need to connect them to form a Super Mario Bros. level that corresponds to a given 3CNF. The connections ensure that Mario traverses the level according to a **consistent Boolean assignment**, enforcing that each Boolean variable has exactly one truth value.

> Connecting gadgets means linking a specific exit of one gadget to a specific entrance of another gadget. In the example below:
> - We connect the false exist of the $x_2$ variable gadget to the literal entrance of $\neg x_2$ in the clause gadget for $c_2$. 
> - Then, we connect the literal exit of $\neg x_2$ of the clause gadget to the false entrance of the $x_3$ variable gadget (since this path correspond to $x_2$ = `false`).
> - This ensures that Mario teleports between gadgets using pipes, enforcing the logical structure of the reduction.
> 
> <img src="assets/images/mario/connecting-gadgets.png" alt="Connecting gadgets" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">

We will now connect the variable gadgets and the clause gadgets. We will use the formula $\phi = (x_1 \vee x_3 \vee \neg x_4) \wedge (\neg x_2 \vee x_3 \vee \neg x_5)$ from earlier to illustrate along the way. 

1. For each variable $x_i$, we connect its exists to all clauses where it appears:
    - The T-exit (if Mario chooses `true`) is connected to **all clause gadgets** where $x_i$ appears positively.
    - The F-exit (if Mario chooses `false`) is connected to **all clause gadgets** where $\neg x_i$ appears.

2. After linking $x_i$ to all relevant clause gadgets, we then connect:
   - The exit of the last clause gadget containing $x_i$ to the T-entrance of the $x_{i+1}$ variable gadget.
   - The exit of the last clause gadget containing $\neg x_i$ to the F-entrance of the $x_{i+1}$ variable gadget.
   - If no such clause gadgets exist, connect directly from the T/F-exit of $x_i$ to the T/F entrance of $x_{i+1}$.

    > For example, $x_1$ only appears in $c_1$ and no clauses contain $\neg x_1$, so we have
    >
    > <img src="assets/images/mario/example-x1.png" alt="Example: x1" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">
    >
    > Similarly, $\neg x_2$ only appears in $c_2$ and no clauses contain $x_2$, so we have
    >
    > <img src="assets/images/mario/example-x2.png" alt="Example: x2" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">
    >
    > Both $c_1$ and $c_2$ contains $x_3$, so
    >
    > <img src="assets/images/mario/example-x3.png" alt="Example: x3" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">
    >
    > We connect similarly for $x_4$ and $x_5$:
    >
    > <img src="assets/images/mario/example-x4.png" alt="Example: x4" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">
    >
    > <img src="assets/images/mario/example-x5.png" alt="Example: x5" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">

So far, if there is a satisifable assignment, there is a path for Mario
 - Starting at $x_1$, going throuugh all clause gadgets containg $x_1$ or $\neg x_1$ using $x_1$'s T or F exit (depending on whether $x_1$ is assigned with True or False)
 - Then get to $x_2$, going through all clause gadgets containing ...
 - ...
 - Then get to $x_n$, going through all clause gadgets containing ...

Next, we want to make sure that every clause has at least one true literal. After the last clause gadget containg $x_n$ or $\neg x_n$, we connect its literal exit to the left entrance of $c_1$. Then, we connect the right exit of $c_1$ to the left entrance of $c_2$, and so on, until $c_m$. 

> <img src="assets/images/mario/final-traversal-connection.png" alt="Example: Final traversal connection" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">

This ensures that Mario must pass through all clause gadgets in sequence before reaching the goal.

- If at least one literal in a clause is `true`, Mario previously toggled the Palace Switch, making the solid block transparent and allowing him to collect a Super Star to pass through the fire bars.
- If all literals in a clause were `false`, its Palace Switch remains inactive, blocking Mario and making the level impassable.

<img src="assets/images/mario/clause-gadget-final-traversal.png" alt="Clause gadget: Final traversal" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">

## Start and End Gadgets

To force the player to be in Super Mario form throughout the level (so that they can't sneak through narrow horizontal path), we have the following start and end gadget, connecting to the entrance of $x_1$ and from the right exit of $c_m$, respectively. 

<img src="assets/images/mario/start-end-gadget.png" alt="Start end gadget" class="centered-img" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">

# Correctness Proof

We now prove that the correctness of the PTMR from $\text{3SAT}$ to $\text{SMB}$ shown above. Specifically, we need to show that

$$
\phi \in \text{3SAT} \iff f(\phi) \in \text{SMB}.
$$

($\implies$) If $\phi$ is satisfiable, Mario follows the truth assignment when choosing exits in variable gadgets. Since each clause contains at least one `true` literal, Mario enters at least one literal entrance per clause, toggling the Palace Switch. During the final traversal, all clause gadgets will have their Palace Switches activated, allowing Mario to collect the Super Star and pass through the fire bars, making the level passable.

($\impliedby$) If $f(\phi)$ is passable, Mario must have reached the goal, meaning he successfully exited all clause gadgets. Since the Super Star is only accessible if a Palace Switch was toggled, Mario must have entered at least one literal entrance per clause, implying at least one literal in each clause was `true`. This directly corresponds to a satisfying assignment for $\phi$, proving $\phi \in \text{3SAT}$. 

# Runtime Analysis

Each gadget consists of a constant number of elements (blocks, pipes, enemies, and power-ups). Given a 3CNF formula with $n$ variables and $m$ clauses, we construct $n$ variable gadgets, $m$ clause gadgets, plus start and end gadgets, resulting in a total of $n+m+2$ gadgets. Since each gadget has constant size and $n \leq 3m$, the overall level size grows linearly with respect to the input size $3m$, making the reduction polynomial-time.

# Closing Remarks

The Super Mario Bros. NP-hardness proof is one of my favorite NP-hard problems. I first presented it during my EECS 376 discussion section in Fall 2024 for Halloween, and my students absolutely loved it. This problem sparked interest in the complexity unit and changed how they thought about theoretical computer science, showing that computational complexity can be explored in a fun and engaging way.

If you're interested in learning more, [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1895)'s the original paper. Note that in the paper they used crossover gadgets (which are much more complicated) instead of pipes and Palace Switches.

I hope this exploration of Super Mario Bros. as an NP-hard problem has been as exciting for you as it has been for me!
